Extends WPGraphQL for WooCommerce by adding aggregated data for creating dynamic product filters on headless frontends.

== Description ==

WooGraphQL Filter Aggregations extends WPGraphQL for WooCommerce by adding aggregated data specifically designed for building dynamic product filters on headless frontends. This plugin does not filter products itself but provides the necessary data to build filter interfaces.

= Features =

* **Price Range Data**: Get minimum and maximum prices from the current product set
* **Attribute Aggregations**: Retrieve all available attribute values with their counts for the current product query 
* **Brand Aggregations**: Obtain all available product brands with their counts
* **Category Hierarchy Support**: Consider parent and child categories when building aggregations
* **Compatible with Existing Filters**: Works alongside your existing product filtering logic

= Use Cases =

* Building faceted navigation in headless WooCommerce stores
* Creating dynamic filter interfaces with accurate counts
* Implementing price range sliders based on actual product data
* Supporting any GraphQL-powered frontend (React, Vue, Next.js, etc.)

= Requirements =

* WordPress 5.8+
* WooCommerce 4.0+
* [WPGraphQL](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-graphql/)
* [WPGraphQL for WooCommerce](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql-woocommerce)

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/woographql-filter-aggregations` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Make sure WPGraphQL and WPGraphQL for WooCommerce are installed and activated.

== Usage ==

After activation, the plugin adds an `aggregations` field to product connections in your GraphQL schema. You can query it like this:

```graphql
query ProductsWithFilters {
  products {
    nodes {
      id
      name
      price
    }
    aggregations {
      priceRange {
        min
        max
      }
      attributes {
        name
        slug
        terms {
          name
          slug
          count
        }
      }
      brands {
        name
        slug
        count
      }
    }
  }
}
```

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin filter products? =

No, this plugin only provides aggregated data about your products to help you build filter interfaces. The actual filtering should be done using WPGraphQL for WooCommerce's existing filter capabilities.

= How does it work with taxonomies? =

The plugin supports product categories, tags, brands and custom product attributes. Brand support requires a `product_brand` taxonomy to be registered.

= Can I extend this for custom taxonomies? =

Yes, you can extend the plugin using WordPress filters. Documentation will be available in future releases.
